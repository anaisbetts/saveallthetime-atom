# Save All The Time

Sometimes when you work with Atom and actually do stuff, you forget to save
your work, and it can be hard to tell that you're in that state. So then you
commit your code and you miss out on the unsaved changes. Or you run the
build, then don't see anything update.

It makes you want to rage!

Until now!

This Atom Package saves everything ALL THE DAMN TIME!

That's it. Carry on with your life. Be productive my friends.

## Seems familiar?

This is a port of the [Visual Studio
Extension](https://github.com/paulcbetts/SaveAllTheTime) of the same name,
only for Atom.
